# ASF Remote Advanced Testing Suite (aka RaTs!)
Note: this project is pretty much abandoned, the ConnectiveHTTP server is the only component still maintained.
You can find the standalone program here: https://github.com/Stefan0436/ConnectiveStandalone

You can check out AutoRelease as a temporary replacement for RaTs!
It is a set of scripts that can publish project builds when a #Release commit is received.
